## React Todo Example
- Built on [React Hot Loader Boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate)
- Utilizes container (smart) components and presentational (dumb) components as described [here](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0#.7z5duddvp) and demonstrated [here](https://gist.github.com/chantastic/fc9e3853464dffdb1e3c)
- Employs ES6 classes (instead of React.createClass) and stateless functional components (presentational/dumb compnents). Below are two good reads on the subject.
